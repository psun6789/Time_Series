# Time_Series

Prediction of Electricity production of Ireland

As a part of my master's thesis:
Developed multiple LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on different window of data and ensemble models to predict hourly power prediction.
Implemented cyclic encoding techniques to perform feature extraction on Time Series data collected from EIRGrid Groups.
Identified best potential candidates by applying Fisher's Score and Random Forest as feature extraction techniques.
Applied windowing on Time Series data which resulted in conversion of original data into multiple window sizes.
